0. OSI model
mandatory
OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) is an abstract model to describe layered communication and computer network design. The idea is to segregate the different parts of what make communication possible.

It is organized from the lowest level to the highest level:

The lowest level: layer 1 which is for transmission on physical layers with electrical impulse, light or radio signal
The highest level: layer 7 which is for application specific communication like SNMP for emails, HTTP for your web browser, etc
Keep in mind that the OSI model is a concept, it’s not even tangible. The OSI model doesn’t perform any functions in the networking process. It is a conceptual framework so we can better understand complex interactions that are happening. Most of the functionality in the OSI model exists in all communications systems.

1. Types of network
2. MAC and IP address
3. UDP and TCP
4. TCP and UDP ports
Once packets have been sent to the right network device using IP using either UDP or TCP as a mode of transportation, it needs to actually enter the network device.

If we continue the comparison of a network device to your house, where IP address is like your postal address, UDP and TCP ports are like the windows and doors of your place. A TCP/UDP network device has 65535 ports. Some of them are officially reserved for a specific usage, some of them are known to be used for a specific usage (but nothing is officially declared) and the rest are free of use.
5. Is the host on the network
